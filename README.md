# Qualys WAS GitHub Action


## Description

The workflow of GitHub Actions has four main steps:
1. Prerequisites
2. Configure GitHub Environment Parameters
3. Configure GitHub Action
4. Download Scan Results

This README document explains how to use the Qualys WAS GitHub Action and gives some samples for your reference.

## How to use the Qualys WAS GitHub Action

1. Visit [GitHub configuration a workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) to enable GitHub Action in your repository.
   [configuring-a-workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow)
2. Subscribe to Qualys WAS module and obtain Qualys credentials.
3. Create GitHub Secrets and variables. Refer to GitHub Action Parameter section below to learn about the parameters.
   Refer to [Encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) for more details on how to set up secrets.
4. Configure your workflow. In the actions steps of run.yaml file use `Qualys/github_action_qwas@main`
5. You can use the Input Parameters to customize GitHub Action as per your requirements.

Note: The `actions/checkout` step is required to run before the scan action, otherwise the action does not have access to the Web apps to be scanned.

## Usage Examples

Qualys WAS GitHub Actions can be used to trigger repository scan in different events. Following are some sample scan events for your reference:

### Scan Web App in your repository on push event

Refer to the below sample to scan web applications in your repository on push event.
```yaml
name: Qualys WAS Scan 
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
    Qualys_was_scan:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        name: Qualys WAS Scan
        steps:
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v3 
            with:
                fetch-depth: 0
    
          - name: Qualys WAS scan action step
            uses: Qualys/github_action_qwas@main
            id: was
            with:
              API_SERVER: ${{ vars.API_SERVER }}
              QUALYS_USERNAME: ${{ vars.QUALYS_USERNAME }}

However, in self-hosted runners, there is no limit on timeout, and you can set a timeout for more than 360 minutes.                                                                                                                              | Optional            | 350           | Variable       |
